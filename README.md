# Generate a list of even numbers

In this small project, we look at multiple variations on how we may structure the code in Python to generate a list of even numbers.

## Set up your environment

Python 3 must be installed and available in your PATH environment variable. Additionally, you may use git to clone the repository.

``` bash
# check that you have the right python version
> python --version
Python 3.9.0

# check that you have pip installed
> python -m pip --version
pip 21.0.1 from [....]

# create a virtual environment
> git clone 

# install project requirements
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Design choices

What is the best way to structure this application? We start with the assumption, that we want the application to run locally (installed on your machine). Then we should ask some questions about the features of the program.
